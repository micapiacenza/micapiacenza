👋 Hi, I’m Micaela!
📍 I am from Argentina, but I have been living on Australia, Gold Coats for the last 5 years.

📚 I studied Software Engineering at Griffith University.

🦋 I code mostly in flutter, is my favourite framework. I have also worked with Flutter for several years. And is my go-to framework for my personal projects. I love staying up to date with best flutter practices and new ways to build cool things.

🌱 I also code in Angular using typescript, html, css/scss and nodejs for the backend.

🤍 I’m passionate about mobile development, and how technology innovations help shape the future and make people's lives better.

🌸 I also enjoy reading, being outdoors (specially going to the beach), and working out.
